# Workout App; By Elliot Lee

## Project Goals
I want a workout app that can fully track my exercises whatever they may be and however my progression and lifts are set up. In the future i would 
like the functionality to not just include weightlifting exercises but also other ones as well, possible timer and rest periods in the future.

## Current Functionality
the app can log multiple routines, each of which contain cycles(weeklike structures that contain daily exercise plans). Each set of exercise plans 
contain multiple exercises and within those exercises sets that we want to set as complete or incomplete. We can create and fully customize these 
aspects, and we can use them once made (setting weight/reps/names). 

## Known Bugs
>maximum stats are shown in the set view, but are not updaed when one of these max stats is deselected, and no other similar lifts are completed
>editing the rep/weight field of the sets in the usage mode; we want to be able to set these to complete or incomplete based on what number is 
    put into this as well

## Planned Functionality
>add a graph of progress throughout routine, over cycles for ALL lifts in the routine
>add ability to put in how many reps you did, save that specific set as the changed values, and mark as complete/incomplete
>add a screen to see how your strength in each percentile ranks whith others (probably by pinging a server)
